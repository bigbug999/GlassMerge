# Power-Up Implementation Guide

## Current Implementation

### Base System
- Power-ups can be equipped in slots at the bottom of the game screen
- Each power-up can occupy 1-3 slots based on its level
- Power-ups can be toggled on/off by tapping
- Only one power-up can be active at a time
- Active power-ups are indicated with colored borders:
  - Super Massive Ball: Blue
  - Negative Ball: Red
  - Magnetic Ball: Purple
- Debug logging tracks activation/deactivation states
- Power-up states persist across game saves
- Active power-ups are tracked per-sphere
- Level-up system prevents duplicate power-up offerings

### Power-Up Structure
```swift
struct PowerUp {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let description: String
    let category: PowerUpCategory
    let type: PowerUpType
    let icon: String
    var isUnlocked: Bool
    var level: Int
    var cost: Int
    var slotIndex: Int?
    var isActive: Bool = false
    var remainingCooldown: TimeInterval = 0
}
```

## Future Enhancements
1. **Cooldown System**
   - Add visual cooldown indicator
   - Implement timer-based cooldown
   - Balance cooldown durations

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Power-up activation effects
   - Status indicators
   - Particle effects

3. **Sound & Haptics**
   - Unique activation sounds
   - Haptic feedback patterns
   - Environmental audio effects

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Power-up tooltips
   - Status effect icons
   - Active duration indicators

## Implementation Notes
- Power-ups are implemented as value types (structs)
- State changes are propagated through the view model
- Each power-up can affect either:
  - Individual balls (single-use)
  - The entire environment (continuous effect)
