# Power-Up Implementation Guide

## Current Implementation

### Base System
- Power-ups can be equipped in slots at the bottom of the game screen
- Each power-up can occupy 1-3 slots based on its level
- Power-ups are organized into three types:
  1. Single-Use (affect next spawned ball)
  2. Environmental (affect entire play area, duration-based)
  3. Targeting (affect existing balls)
- Environmental power-ups have a two-stage activation:
  1. Prime (50% opacity border)
  2. Active (100% opacity border)
- Environmental power-ups have duration timers:
  - Base duration: 10 seconds
  - +2 seconds per level
  - Visual countdown indicator
  - Auto-deactivation when expired
- Only one power-up can be active at a time per type
- Active power-ups are indicated with colored borders:
  - Super Massive Ball: Blue
  - Negative Ball: Red
  - Magnetic Ball: Purple
  - Low Gravity: Blue
  - Rubber World: Green
  - Ice World: Cyan
- Debug logging tracks activation/deactivation states
- Power-up states persist across game saves
- Active power-ups are tracked per-sphere
- Level-up system prevents duplicate power-up offerings

### Power-Up Structure
```swift
struct PowerUp {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let description: String
    let category: PowerUpCategory
    let type: PowerUpType
    let icon: String
    var isUnlocked: Bool
    var level: Int
    var cost: Int
    var slotIndex: Int?
    var isActive: Bool = false
    var isPrimed: Bool = false
    var remainingDuration: TimeInterval = 0
}

struct PowerUpStats {
    var duration: TimeInterval?  // nil for single-use, 10s base for environmental
    var forceMagnitude: Double   // Effect strength multiplier
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- Power-ups are implemented as value types (structs)
- State changes are propagated through the view model
- Power-ups are categorized by type:
  - Single-use: Affect next spawned ball
  - Environmental: Timed effects on play area
  - Targeting: Affect existing balls
- Environmental power-ups use a sophisticated duration system
- Multiple power-up types can be active simultaneously
