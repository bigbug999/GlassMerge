# Power-Up Implementation Guide

## Current Implementation

### Base System
- Power-ups can be equipped in slots at the bottom of the game screen
- Each power-up can occupy 1-3 slots based on its level
- Power-ups can be toggled on/off by tapping
- Active power-ups are indicated with a blue border
- Debug logging tracks activation/deactivation states

### Power-Up Structure
```swift
struct PowerUp {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let description: String
    let category: PowerUpCategory
    let type: PowerUpType
    let icon: String
    var isUnlocked: Bool
    var level: Int
    var cost: Int
    var slotIndex: Int?
    var isActive: Bool = false
    var remainingCooldown: TimeInterval = 0
}
```

## Categories & Implementation Status

### 1. Gravity Category
#### Super Massive Ball
- **Status**: Not Implemented
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - [ ] Modify ball physics properties when power-up is active
  - [ ] Increase mass and downward force on release
  - [ ] Add visual indicator for affected ball
  - [ ] Add screen shake on impact

#### Low Gravity Environment
- **Status**: Not Implemented
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - [ ] Modify world gravity when active
  - [ ] Add visual particles/effects
  - [ ] Smooth transition between gravity states

### 2. Magnetism Category
#### Magnetic Ball & Repulsion Field
- **Status**: Not Implemented
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - [ ] Implement attraction/repulsion forces
  - [ ] Add magnetic field visualization
  - [ ] Handle multi-ball interactions

### 3. Void Category
#### Negative Ball & Selective Deletion
- **Status**: Not Implemented
- **Implementation Plan**:
  - [ ] Implement ball removal mechanics
  - [ ] Add deletion animations
  - [ ] Handle scoring for removed balls

## Future Enhancements
1. **Cooldown System**
   - Add visual cooldown indicator
   - Implement timer-based cooldown
   - Balance cooldown durations

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Power-up activation effects
   - Status indicators
   - Particle effects

3. **Sound & Haptics**
   - Unique activation sounds
   - Haptic feedback patterns
   - Environmental audio effects

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Power-up tooltips
   - Status effect icons
   - Active duration indicators

## Implementation Notes
- Power-ups are implemented as value types (structs)
- State changes are propagated through the view model
- Each power-up can affect either:
  - Individual balls (single-use)
  - The entire environment (continuous effect)
